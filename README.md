## Cinecoop Movie App

[Cinecoop](https://cinecoop.vercel.app/), the social network for movie lovers, lets you track and review films you've watched, save ones you want to watch, share with friends and discover from strangers.

Easily create lists - movies with a common theme? your favorite director? Oscar winners? - and view other users lists for inspiration, which you can save to your favorite lists for quick reference.

You can save films to your watchlist so you never forget about that movie your bestie said you had to see. When you mark a film as watched it will stay in your collection, you can add a review (or not) but your friends will see it's safe to discuss spoilers with you! Regardless of watch status, add movies to your favorites so you can always find them and flaunt your unqiue taste to other users. 

See what's playing, what's popular and top rated in realtime. Search for movies by title, year with more search and filter features coming soon including searching for users and lists.
